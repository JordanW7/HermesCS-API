HermesCS
A Web App built for first-class Customer Service by JordanFWilson.com

This app is a ticketing tool for operating a Contact Centre. HermesCS helps manage customer info and record, manage and complete customer service requests in a fast and modern way. The app will work both in the office or out in the field on any kind of device.

User Guide:

New Request Page:
When a customer contacts the company, details of this interaction can be recorded by filling out a "New Request". If this interaction has something that needs to be actioned further by another team or person (i.e. updating information, requesting something to be fixed, requesting a callback from another team with some information), this new request form can be allocated to the relevant person.

Dashboard:
The dashboard shows all of the outstanding customer requests that have been allocated to you and/or your team. From here, you can view the details of the customer requests, complete any required actions, leave notes on the request and update their status to being completed.

Request Search:
Requests that are in the system can be searched via their reference number, or any of the customer's details that might have been added to the request (phone number, account number, etc). By looking up the request, you can check all the information that was added at the time of submitting and any comments and progress since. If searching with a customer detail, the request search will show all matches, showing all of the requests in the system for that customer; this shows a clear customer history.

Mobile Responsive Web App:
Unlike traditional "desktop" contact centre applications, this app can be used on any device in the office or in the field. Therefore, a person in the contact centre can lodge a request and someone in the field can receive it and action it immediately on their phone or tablet.
